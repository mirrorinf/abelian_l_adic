This is a survey about the images of Galois representations defined by torsion points of elliptic curves over algebraic number fields, with a focus on Serre’s open image theorem and surjectivity theorem.

The absolute Galois group acts naturally on torsion points of elliptic curves. The group structure on elliptic curves allows such action to induce for each prime $\ell$ an $\ell$-adic representation.
It is well-known that when the elliptic curve has complex multiplication, the image of the Galois representations so defined are abelian.
Serre proved that, if the elliptic curve has no complex multiplication, then the Galois representation attached to it is almost always surjective.
The proof requires a systematic theory of $\ell$-adic representations and features the synergy of the algebraic properties of the Galois group and $\ell$-adic Lie groups, together with geometric properties of elliptic curves.

This article introduces Serre’s proofs in detail, from $\ell$-adic representations to the main theorems. Additionally, some related work by Serre himself and others are introduced briefly.
